# 🚲 CitiBike Trip Data – End-to-End Data Pipeline

## 1. Problem Description

CitiBike generates a very large volume of trip data every day. Due to the raw, compressed, and unstructured nature of this data, it is not immediately suitable for analysis or reporting. Without proper organization and processing, extracting reliable insights from the data becomes challenging.


## 📅 Data Analysis Period
**December 30, 2024 – January 31, 2025**

## 📂 Data Source
The raw data used in this project comes from **Citi Bike’s public trip data repository**.

- The data is **publicly available**
- It is provided as **compressed ZIP files**
- Each file contains detailed records of Citi Bike trips for a given month

### 🔗 Official Source
The dataset for this analysis was downloaded directly from the official Citi Bike S3 bucket:

- **Source URL:** https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/202501-citibike-tripdata.zip


### 📄 Dataset Fields

The dataset includes the following attributes:

- Ride ID  
- Rideable type  
- Started at  
- Ended at  
- Start station name  
- Start station ID  
- End station name  
- End station ID  
- Start latitude  
- Start longitude  
- End latitude  
- End longitude  
- Member or casual rider type

## 2. Business Questions

1. What is the total number of CitiBike trips during the analysis period?
2. Which start stations generate the highest number of trips?
3. How does ride efficiency differ between electric bikes and classic bikes?
4. What is the distribution of trips by ride duration category (short, medium, long)?
5. How does daily trip volume evolve over time?
6. How do trips compare between members and casual users?

## 3. Project Objectives

The objectives of this project are to:

- Prepare and store raw CitiBike trip data in Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
- Organize the raw data into a structured data lake layout
- Load the data into BigQuery as partitioned and clustered tables
- Optimize data for analytical queries and performance
- Build dashboards to visualize key metrics and insights

## 4. 🛠️ Technology Overview

1. **Terraform** provisions infrastructure on GCP (VM, storage buckets, datasets).  
2. **Airflow** runs ETL: downloads CitiBike ZIP files, unzips, converts CSV to Parquet, uploads to **GCS**.  
3. **BigQuery** reads data from **GCS**, creating external tables, then partitioned & clustered tables.  
4. **dbt** applies transformations and builds analytical views for reporting.  
5. **Looker Studio** visualizes insights using the transformed data.
